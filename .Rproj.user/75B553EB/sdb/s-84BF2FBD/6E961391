You can include R chunks like so:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nYou'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nIn that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!\n",
