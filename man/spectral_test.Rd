\title{Spectral Density Test}
\usage{
spectral_test(f_data, kernel = "Bartlett", bandwidth = "adaptive",
  alpha = 0.05, suppress_raw_output = FALSE,
  suppress_print_output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_data}{The functional data matrix with observed functions in the columns}

\item{kernel}{A String specifying the kernel function to use. The currently supported kernels are the
'Bartlett' and  'Parzen' kernels. The default kernel is 'Bartlett'.}

\item{bandwidth}{A String or positive Integer value which specifies the bandwidth to use. Currently admitted
string handles are 'static' which computes the bandwidth p via p = n^(1/(2q+1)) where n is the sample size
and q is the kernel order, or 'adaptive' which uses a bandwidth selection method that is based on the
functional data.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the significance level to be used for the test.
The significance level is 0.05 by default. Note, the significance value is only ever used to compute the
1-alpha quantile of the limiting distribution of the specified test's test statistic.}

\item{suppress_raw_output}{Boolean value, FALSE by default. If TRUE, the function will not return the list
containing the p-value, quantile, and statistic.}

\item{suppress_print_output}{Boolean value, FALSE by default. If TRUE, the function will not print any
output to the console.}
}
\value{
If suppress_raw_output = FALSE, a list containing the test statistic, the 1-alpha quantile of the
limiting distribution, and the p-value computed from the specified hypothesis test. Also prints output
containing a short description of the test, the p-value, and additional information about the test if
suppress_print_output = FALSE.
}
\description{
The "spectral" portmanteau test is based on the spectral density operator. It essentially measures
the proximity of a functional time series to a white noise - the constant spectral density operator of an
uncorrelated series. Unlike the "single-lag" and "multi-lag" tests, this test is not for general white noise
series, and may not hold under functional conditionally heteroscedastic assumptions.
}
\details{
\code{spectral_test} Computes the spectral hypothesis test under a user-specified kernel function and
bandwidth; automatic bandwidth selection methods are provided.

\examples{
b <- brown_motion(100, 50)
spectral_test(b)
spectral_test(b, kernel = 'Parzen', bandwidth = 'adaptive')
spectral_test(b, kernel = 'Bartlett', bandwidth = 2)
