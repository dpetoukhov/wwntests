## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added detail to the Description field in the DESCRIPTION file; now directly referencing the available tests. This has added an additional note about potentially mis-spelled words - none are actually mis-spelled.
* Added references for the tests used to the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file, including DOI numbers.
* Replaced all instances of the cat() function by message().

## Test environments
* local macOS Sierra 10.12.6 install, R 3.4.0
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, 32/64 bit, R-devel
* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, GCC, R-release
